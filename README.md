## Welcome, Little Word Wizard of the Adventerous Explorer Type! 🦄

Every day a secret 5-letter word hides inside the magic grid from a backend api which Mr. Holt I believe wrote himself.
Can YOU find it in 6 tries or fewer?  
Green = perfect spot! 🟩  
Yellow = sneaky letter hiding somewhere else! 🟨  
Gray = not in the word today! ⬜  

Win and watch the happy confetti explosion! 🎉🍭

### Super Fun Modes
- Daily Magic Word 🌈 (same mystery for everyone on Earth!)
- Endless Practice Land 🏰 (play a billion times if you want!)
- Stats Crown 👑 (see your win streak grow bigger and bigger!)


## Tech Magic (for grown-up wizards)
- Pure HTML + CSS + Vanilla JS ⚡ (no heavy potions needed)
- Saves your streak with browser cookies 🍪
- Works on phones, tablets, and even school Chromebooks! 📱

git clone https://github.com/JPixelByte/wordmaster.git
